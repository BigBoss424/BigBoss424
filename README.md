# BigBoss424 | Aaron Jones

----

I am an aspiring programmer and entrepenuer. I run a somewhat functional business, [Cogs Web Development and Hosting](https://www.cogswebdevelopmentandhosting.com). In which, I build websites, develop web applications, manage web marketing, host websites, and maintain small business websites. I am currently a student at [Western Governors University](https://www.wgu.edu), pursuing a BS in Computer Science. 

I am utilzing Github as a means to develop and learn how to be a better developer. Join me as I develop my software, on a journey to create software that will help others along their journey as well.
